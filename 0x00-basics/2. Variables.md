# Variable
-It is a labeled container for holding information.  
-Values (eg. numbers, texts etc) are stored inside variables.
-variables can be declared using either the var, let or const keyword.
-It is recommended that you use the let keyword as the var keyword is outdated.
-Const keyword is usually used for values that are bnot meant to change.

- It is reasonable to write variables in a .js file.
- To declare a var value, you write var>name= "value". name is the variable.
eg. var.name= "Annete"


-To declare a "let" value, you write,
eg. let name= "Anete";
    console.log(name)
    let firstName= "Mark"
    let age be =22

    Console.log(firstName, age).
    In this case, when you execute the code, the terminal will display (Annete, 22).
    
    -Cont. declares values that should not change, such as speed of light etc.
  
 ## Rules
    -Variables can only start with letter, underscore r the dollar sign.
    -Variable names cannot be JS reserved keywords.
    -Not special characters in variables.
    - Use meaningful names.
    - Multiple variable names can only be separated using camel case conversions or hyphen symbols.
