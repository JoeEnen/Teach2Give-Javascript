# Javascript
-a web-programming language for adding interactivity and dynamic functionalities to websites. 

# Including Javascript
You can add JS to HTML via either rof the following ways:
1. Internal JS
2. External JS

## Internal JS
- In this case, we write JS inside a <script> tag in html.
## External JS
-This stores JS in a separate  -js file. The file is later linked to HTMLusing teh <script> tags with a src attribute.
eg. <script src" app.js"> </script>
-In this case, you may want to ensure that you put the link near the end of your html to ensure html loads last.
-Alternatively, ensure you add the (defer) keyword as shown below:
<script defer src" app.js"> </script>
-For the above case, you can put the link up near title in html.
