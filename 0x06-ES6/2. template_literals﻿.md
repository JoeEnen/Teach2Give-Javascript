# Template Literals
- Template literals (introduced in ES6), provide a more readable and flexible way to work with strings. They use backticks (`) instead of quotes (' or ").

# Key Features
## String Interpolation (Injecting Variables)
-Before ES6 (Using + for concatenation):
eg.
 const name = "Dennis";
const age = 25;
console.log("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");

- with template literal:
console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`);

## Multi-line Strings (No Need for \n)
Before ES6:

const multiLine = "This is line 1\n" + "This is line 2\n" + "This is line 3";

With Template Literals:

const multiLine = `This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3`;

## Expressions Inside Template Literals
You can embed expressions directly inside ${}.

let a = 10, b = 20;
function product(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}
console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b} and the product is ${product(a, b)}`);
