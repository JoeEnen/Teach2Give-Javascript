# Arrow Functions in JavaScript
- Arrow functions (=>) were introduced in ES6 to provide a shorter and cleaner syntax for writing functions.

## Key Features
. More concise – Removes the need for the function keyword.
. No explicit return – If the function has only one expression, it returns the result automatically.
. No own this – Arrow functions inherit this from their surrounding scope, making them unsuitable as object methods.

### Example: Before vs After
#### Traditional Function:
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

#### Arrow Function Equivalent:
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

## Best Use Cases
1. Array methods (map, filter, reduce)
2. Event listeners
3. Simplifying callback functions
- Arrow functions improve code readability and are great for functional programming patterns.
